# Digital Circuit Design w/ VHDL
A brief summary of the course:

The student will acquire complete knowledge in the field of digital design with emphasis on the design and implementation of integrated digital systems, using schematic entry and hardware description languages ​​(HDL).  

The content of the course includes the following:  
• Analysis and design of synchronous sequential and combinational circuits.  
• The study of the various types of memories, designing arithmetic building blocks and circuit design using VHLD.  
• Methods of controlling the correct functioning of digital systems.  

**Lab**: The lab taught us about the VHDL language. I wrote a few basic VHDL scripts creating simple circuits like flip-flops, adders and decoders, among other things, but I also had a big assignment to complete which was designing MIPS in VHDL. This what I will be uploading in this repo.
